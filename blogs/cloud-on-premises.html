        <h1>Cloud vs On-premise</h1>
        <p>Some businesses in highly regulated industries normally house their applications on the premises.
        Knowing your data is located within your in-house servers and IT infrastructure might also provide more peace of mind.
        On-premise software requires that an enterprise purchases a license or a copy of the software to use it.
        Because the software itself is licensed and the entire instance of software resides within an organization’s premises, there is generally greater protection than with a cloud computing infrastructure. 
        </p>
        
        <p>A company hosts everything in-house in an on-premise environment, while in a cloud environment, a third-party provider hosts all that for you.
        This allows companies to pay on an as-needed basis and effectively scale up or down depending on overall usage, user requirements, and the growth of a company.
        A cloud-based server utilizes virtual technology to host a company’s applications offsite.
        There are no capital expenses, data can be backed up regularly, and companies only have to pay for the resources they use.</p>

         <h2>Key differences of On-premise vs Cloud</h2>
        <u><b>Deployment</b></u>
         <p><b>Cloud:</b> While there are different forms of cloud computing (such as public cloud, private cloud, and a hybrid cloud), in a public cloud computing environment, resources are hosted on the premises of the service provider but enterprises are able to access those resources and use as much as they want at any given time. </p>
         <p><b>On Premises:</b> In an on-premises environment, resources are deployed in-house and within an enterprise’s IT infrastructure.
         An enterprise is responsible for maintaining the solution and all its related processes.
         <p>

        <u><b>Cost</b></u>
         <p><b>Cloud:</b>Enterprises that elect to use a cloud computing model only need to pay for the resources that they use, with none of the maintenance and upkeep costs, and the price adjusts up or down depending on how much is consumed.</p>
         <p><b>On Premises:</b>For enterprises that deploy software on premise, they are responsible for the ongoing costs of the server hardware, power consumption, and space.<p>

         <u><b>Control</b></u>
        <p><b>Cloud:</b>Data and encryption keys reside within your third-party provider, so if the unexpected happens and there is downtime, you maybe be unable to access that data.</p>
        <p><b>On Premises:</b>In an on-premises environment, enterprises retain all their data and are fully in control of what happens to it, for better or worse.<p> 

         <u><b>Security</b></u>
        <p><b>Cloud:</b>There have been many publicized cloud breaches, and IT departments around the world are concerned.
        From personal information of employees such as login credentials to a loss of intellectual property, the security threats are real.</p>
        <p><b>On Premises:</b>Despite the promise of the cloud, security is the primary concern for many industries, so an on-premises environment, despite some of its drawbacks and price tag, make more sense.</p>

        <u><b>Compliance</b></u>
        <p><b>Cloud:</b>Enterprises that do choose a cloud computing model must do their due diligence and ensure that their third-party provider is up to code and in fact compliant with all of the different regulatory mandates within their industry.
         Sensitive data must be secured, and customers, partners, and employees must have their privacy ensured.</p>
        <p><b>On Premises:</b>any companies these days operate under some form of regulatory control, regardless of the industry.
         Perhaps the most common one is the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) for private health information, but there are many others, including the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA), which contains detailed student records, and other government and industry regulations.</p>
