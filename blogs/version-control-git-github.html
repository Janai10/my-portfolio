        <h1>Explanation</h1>
        <p>Version Control is a class of systems that practice the act of tracking and managing changes to computer programs, documents, large web sites, or other collections of information.</p>
        <p>Git is a free and open source distributed version control system for tracking changes in any set of files, usually used for coordinating work among programmers collaboratively developing source code during software development.
            Its goals include speed, data integrity, and support for distributed, non-linear workflows.</p>
        <p>GitHub is a provider of Internet hosting for software development and version control using Git.
         It offers the distributed version control and source code management functionality of Git, plus its own features.</p>
        <p>Each of these systems need eachother; GitHub uses git while git uses version control to run.</p>

         <h2>Differences</h2>
        <ol>
         <li>Git vs GitHub: Git is a version control system that lets you manage and keep track of your source code history.
         GitHub is a cloud-based hosting service that lets you manage Git repositories.
         In other words GitHub is where Git is used.</li>
         <li>Git vs Version Control: As explained before git is a type of version control that is faster to commit in comparision to other types.
            It is faster because you commit to the central repository more often in SVN, network traffic slows everyone down.
         Whereas with Git, you're working mostly on your local repository and only committing to the central repository every so often.
